# Projects-in-Processing
This repository contains some of the simple visual projects I created in 2018-2019 using Processing.

At that time, I was on the very beginning of my programming journey, and essentially these projects are among the first over-100-lines-of-code programs I've ever written. Accordingly, the code is rather unprofessional, repetitive and spaghetti, however, they get the job done most of the time.
